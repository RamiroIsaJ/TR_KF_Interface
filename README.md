# TR_KF Interface
TR_KF by **Multi Tracking objects with Kalman Filter** is a GUI Interface programmed in *PYTHON* using PySimpleGUI for object detection and tracking process in a sequence of images.
This is a test version 0.2.1

In directory */src*, you will find an user guide document.

## Run of TR_KF Interface
This program can be used for object detection and evaluated the performance of filter and morphological operations which could be changed. Repeatibility measure is used to show results.
For multi-tracking, Kalman Filter is used where features detected are identified in a radius value. 

## Results of TR_KF Interface
Results of whole set of features traked are presented in 2 graphics which are related with mean distance and mean velocity computed during the sequence of images.
Error is the measure of Kalman filter for detection process.

TR_KF Interface will be presented in a **scientific paper** in the next months.
